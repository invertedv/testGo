## A Self-Service Program to Build Mortgage Models

goMortgage is an app that builds mortgage forecasting models.  goMortgage can both
build the modeling dataset and the model.

What aspects of mortgage performance can be modeled? Really, anything you can think of.  The software
is agnostic about its target and features. Think of it as a flexible framework for model building.

As you might imagine, there are many items that must be specified when building a model.  goMortgage
takes a file (.gom) which specifies these.

Since goMortgage is open source, goMortgage can be modified to suit your needs.
Out of the box, it is configured to work with Freddie and Fannie data.
